# Off-line signature verification using elementary combinations of directional codes from boundary pixels
Offline signature verification methods are based on the visual characteristics of the signature. Among several features, the segments of the signature's contour, their types, and their count can be informative. M. D. Ajij and his colleagues (2021) broke down the signature's contour into line segments and then categorized them based on their shapes. According to their study, the number of consecutive line segments and the different types of line segments in the signature's contour can be important features. The task for the candidate is to implement the method proposed by Ajij and his colleagues in any programming language and evaluate its performance.
